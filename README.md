  Abstract
  
 This paper investigates the implications of Danish sector banks' non-interest income on firm performance and risk. Understanding the effects of non-interest income specifically in Denmark is motivated by the proliferation of negative rate monetary policy in Europe and Japan where research is becoming increasingly concerned with the stability of financial systems as negative rates persist. Employing a sample of 38 publicly-traded banks in Denmark for the period 1991-2018, this paper finds that a higher level of non-interest income is associated with increases in bank performance, as measured by both Return on Average Assets (ROAA) and Return on Average Equity (ROAE). Non-interest income is normalized by total assets and is also decomposed into its three common subcomponents for more detailed analysis: trading income, fees & commissions, and other non-interest income. Trading income is found to be the primary driver of heightened performance. To evaluate bank risk, Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) is calculated as a systemic measure and Historical Value at Risk (HVaR) as an individual measure. Trading income is found to be the singular component of non-interest income associated with increased systemic risk. Non-interest income as a whole relates to higher individual bank risk. Fees & commissions and other non-interest income are found to be the two drivers of increased individual bank risk. These results generally align with literature that emphasizes non-interest income's ability to improve performance, but are contrary to those that find risk diversification gains from non-interest income activities.
